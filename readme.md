# Python File Differ
This simple script compares two text files, line by line, for differences.

## How to Use
From a terminal with Python 3 installed, you can use the following command to test the script with the included sample files: `python3 .\filediff.py -f1 ./sample/file1.txt -f2 ./sample/file2.txt`

`-f1` or `--file1` specifies the location of the first input file.
`-f2` or `--file2` specifies the location of the second input file.
